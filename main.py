#In number theory, a happy number is a number which eventually reaches 1 when replaced by the sum of the square of each digit
#On the other hand, 4 is not a happy number because the sequence starting with 4**2 he number that started the sequence,
#and so the process continues in an infinite cycle without ever reaching 1. A number which is not happy is called sad or unhappy.
